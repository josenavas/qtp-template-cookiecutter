`Qiita <https://github.com/biocore/qiita/>`__ (canonically pronounced *cheetah*)
is an analysis environment for microbiome (and other "comparative -omics")
datasets.

This package includes the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} Qiita type plugin.

#TODO: Add a description of the artifact types described in this type plugin.

How to test this package?
-------------------------
In order to test the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} package, a local
installation of Qiita should be running in test mode on the address
`https://localhost:21174`, with the default test database created in Qiita's
test suite. Also, if Qiita is running with the default server SSL certificate,
you need to export the variable `QIITA_SERVER_CERT` in your environment, so the
Qiita Client can perform secure connections against the Qiita server:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export QIITA_SERVER_CERT=<QIITA_INSTALL_PATH>/qiita_core/support_files/server.crt
